## Win32 binary executable file

This binary file is generated on a HYPER-V virtual machine. There is a Windows XP and installed ruby version 1.9. To generate the .exe file is used the gem "ocra" (repository: https://github.com/larsch/ocra). The programme should be executable on all later versions of the Windows OS without any problems.
